Given n non-negative integers in array representing an elevation map where the width of each bar is 1, compute how much water it is able to trap after raining.
For example:
Input:
3
2 0 2
Output:
2
Structure is like below
| |
|_|
We can trap 2 units of water in the middle gap.

Input:
The first line of input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
Each test case contains an integer N followed by N numbers to be stored in array.

Output:
Print trap units of water in the middle gap.

Constraints:
1<=T<=100
3<=N<=100
0<=Arr[i]<10

Example:
Input:
2
4
7 4 0 9
3
6 9 9

Output:
10
